This is a text file to state what rules will be used in the evaluation function

The evaluation function will operate by examining a board position and
determining a numerical rating for both teams based on the position and amount
of pieces of each colour.


Positional ratings of each team will consist of a integer value from
0 - 10,000 (inclusive), this will involve rating each individual piece on the
board and determining if it is in a good position.

A checkmate position for either team will result in a positional rating of
10,000 for the colour that delivers checkmate and a 0 rating for the colour
that gets checkmated

For a piece rating, each type of piece will be assigned a rating between and the
sum of all the ratings will be between 0 - 5000 (inclusive)
and contribute to the colour's overall piece rating, when a piece is captured
its piece rating is removed from the overall piece rating. As a consequence of
this, each team always start with 5000 piece rating.

Along with this, a king will have a danger level function and depending on the
level of danger the king is in (possible checks, in an open area, squares
beside it are attacked...) the pieces will act accordingly


Piece Rating
-------------
pawn: 100
horse: 350
bishop: 400
rook: 600
queen: 1500
king: No rating, if a king is taken it is checkmate

With these ratings, we can see the worth of every piece in terms of the pawns,
a bishop is worth 4 pawns, a rook worth 6... this

(8 * pawn) + (2 * horse) + (2 * bishop) + (2 * rook) + (1 * queen) =
800 + 700 + 800 + 1200 + 1500 = 5000
5000 overall piece rating with every piece



Positional Rating
-----------------
The position evaluation function will evaluate each piece and give a numerical
value to how good its position is and sum it to the colours total positional
rating

Factors that will cause a greater rating for the piece

For purposes of this documentation the move number will be labeled,

Moves: 1 - 6: opening phase
Moves: 7 - 20: developing phase
Moves: 20 - 30: late game phase
Moves: 35 + : Endgame

These phases can obviously vary, endgames can happen much earlier than Move 35
for example and this will be adjusted for, these are just general estimates


Definition of an open position: Compared to a previous position, there are less
pieces covering a specific square than before, file or row in in square becomes
lengthened (pawn captures and opens up file for a rook), less pieces occupying
squares near the square we are evaluating

Pawn:
    Opening Phase:
    - Being connected to other pawns
    - Forming long chains
    - Blocking enemy pieces vision + advancements
    - opening up vision for ally pieces

    Developing Phase:
    - Not getting doubled up
    - Try to stay in linked chain formation

    Late Game Phase:
    - Becoming a passed pawn

    Endgame:
    - Promoting

Rook:
    All phases:
    - Checks
    - Pin enemy pieces

    Late Game Phase:
    - Pressure squares and pieces near enemy king
